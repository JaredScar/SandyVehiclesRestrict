# SandyVehiclesRestrict

##Version 1.0

This is a pretty simple script, but I felt a need for it.

What this script does is restricts vehicles for all users on the server if the AOP is Sandy Shores. The way this is done is by a command being ran.

##### KEEP IN MIND: The restrictions list is missing a lot of super and sports vehicles. You can easily add their spawn codes into the list in client.lua via “restrictList” list.

## Commands:
/sandy on - Turns the restrictions for vehicles on
/sandy off - Turns the restrictions for vehicles off

Upon running /sandy on, a message will be sent like:
![sandy on](https://i.gyazo.com/41007ac9017291a2785c082a27882bda.png)
Upon running /sandy off, a message will be sent like:
![sandy off](https://i.gyazo.com/3d65d82458daab2698005cad83d4de65.png)
Now what happens in game when users try to drive the super cars whilst the restrictions are on you ask?:

They simply get kicked out of the vehicle :slight_smile:
